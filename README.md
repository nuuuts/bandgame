		<b>The Band Game</b> is an easy and fun way to spend time with friends on road/ferry/plane trips.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Rules</b> of the game are simple: 
		<ol type='1'>
			<li>Come up with a name of a band that you for sure know exists.</li>
			<li>Same as above, but starting with the last letter of the previous band</li>
		</ol>
		<b>Example chain:</b><br/>
		Embreac<i>h</i> -> <b>H</b>elevor<i>n</i> -> <b>N</b>e Obliviscari<i>s</i> ... and so on.
	</p>
	<p>
		That's it!
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Optional house rules:</b>
		<ul>
			<li>If no one can come up with any bands starting with a given letter, it may be deemed a wildcard letter and any band can be named next</li>
			<li>A time limit of some sort may be applied to keep the ball rolling.</li>
			<li>Try to fill up your entire alphabet with at least one artist.</li>
			<li>If an artist performs under the names "Artist" and "Artist and the Bandnames" both are expended upon the first being used, e.g. <i>John Doe</i> vs <i>John Doe and the Anonymous</i>.</li>
		</ul>
